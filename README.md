# quill-table-widget

A basic UI module for managing tables with Quill v2

[Demo](https://amyasmith.github.io/quill-table-widget/)

## Features

- Adds a menu to the toolbar for adding tables of various sizes
- Displays a widget at the top-right corner of tables when selected
- This widget allows:
  - Adding a row below the cursor
  - Adding a column to the left of the cursor
  - Removing the row below the cursor
  - Removing the column below the cursor
  - Removing the entire table

## Usage

```bash
npm i quill-table-widget
```

```js
import Widget from "quill-table-widget";
import Quill from "quill";
...

Quill.register("modules/tableWidget", Widget);
const quill = new Quill(editorContainer, {
   theme: "snow",
   modules: {
	table: true,
	tableWidget: {
		toolbarOffset: -1,
		maxSize: [5, 6]
	}
   }
  });
```

`toolbarOffset: number`: If specified, moves toolbar button to preceed child `n` of the toolbar. Negative numbers are supported, e.g. `-1` will place it before the last child. If unspecified the button is added to the end of the toolbar.

`maxSize: [number, number]`: Change the maximum size of table that can be created, valid between 2x2 and 12x12. Default is 5x6.

Both the table and tableWidget modules must be enabled.
